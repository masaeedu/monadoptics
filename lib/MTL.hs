-- We want to solve the n Ã— m instances problem in MTL, where:
-- - Adding a new class necessitates writing "lifting" instances for each existing transformer (often with manual finagling in the negative positions)
-- - Adding a new transformer necessitates witnessing "lifting" instances for every class (again, often with special logic for operations that refer to
--   the monad in the negative position)

-- As a case study, we will look at the MonadWriter class:

-- class (Monoid w, Monad m) => MonadWriter w m | m -> w
--   where
--   writer :: (a,w) -> m a
--   tell   :: w -> m ()
--   listen :: m a -> m (a, w)
--   pass   :: m (a, w -> w) -> m a

-- To simulate independence of the class and the transformers, we will work with the following three *non*-WriterT monad transformers:
-- - ExceptT
-- - ReaderT
-- - StateT

-- First we will fix the problem of "negative" positions. The mixed variance of the `m` parameter in various MonadXYZ classes makes
-- things confusing. To address this, we will introduce two separate parameters, a "negative" m variable and a "positive" n variable.

-- Moreover, in order to understand the structure of the problem more easily, we will treat the evidence corresponding to the class as
-- a simple datatype (i..e we will "scrap our typeclasses").

-- This data type would look something like this:

-- data MonadWriter w m n
--   = MonadWriter
--   { write  :: forall a. (a, w) -> n a
--   , tell   ::           w -> n ()
--   , listen :: forall a. m a -> n (a, w)
--   , pass   :: forall a. m (a, w -> w) -> n a
--   }

-- However, in order to futher zoom in on and understand the behavior of the different operations, we will treat each operation in the
-- record as its own independent type.

-- Hence we will have:

newtype Write  w m n = Write  { getWrite  :: forall x. (w, x) -> n x        }
newtype Tell   w m n = Tell   { getTell   ::           w -> n ()            }
newtype Listen w m n = Listen { getListen :: forall x. m x -> n (w, x)      }
newtype Pass   w m n = Pass   { getPass   :: forall x. m (Endo w, x) -> n x }

-- And then we will glue them all together into a dictionary like so:

data MonadWriter w m n
  = MonadWriter
  { write  :: Write  w m n
  , tell   :: Tell   w m n
  , listen :: Listen w m n
  , pass   :: Pass   w m n
  }

-- Now the first interesting thing to note about these operations is that they all form profunctors. In other words, they have instances
-- for the class `HProfunctor :: (* -> *) -> (* -> *) -> *`.

instance HProfunctor (Write w)
  where
  hdimap _ g (Write w) = Write $ g . w

instance HProfunctor (Tell w)
  where
  hdimap _ g (Tell t) = Tell $ g . t

instance HProfunctor (Listen w)
  where
  hdimap f g (Listen l) = Listen $ g . l . f

instance HProfunctor (Pass w)
  where
  hdimap f g (Pass p') = Pass $ g . p' . f

instance HProfunctor (MonadWriter w)
  where
  hdimap f g (MonadWriter w t l p) = MonadWriter (hdimap f g w) (hdimap f g t) (hdimap f g l) (hdimap f g p)

-- These instances allow us to use provided natural transformations to independently modify the "output" and "input" occurrences of the monad
-- to be transformed in the signature of the operation. For example, when we implement an operation like this:

-- writer = lift . writer

-- We would like to instead be able to abstractly map the `lift` operation in the covariant position, thus being able to hide differences
-- in the structure of different operations.

-- The first two operations are phantom in their negative parameter (i.e. are totally covariant), which means we can also witness a bifunctor
-- instance. The contradiction in the variance of the first parameter can be used to introduce arbitrary evidence to change the phantom type
-- in the negative position.

-- Here are the bifunctor instances for the first two operations.

instance HBifunctor (Write w)
  where
  hbimap _ g (Write w) = Write $ g . w

instance HBifunctor (Tell w)
  where
  hbimap _ g (Tell t) = Tell $ g . t

-- And here is the resulting operation (which is stronger than dimap, since the negative type can be varied without having to provide a
-- reverse natural transformation)

-- hmap :: (HBifunctor p, HProfunctor p) => (b ~> b') -> p a b -> p a' b'

-- We can use `hmap` to generically `lift` the occurrences of a monad in an operation signature that only refers to it in positive position.

liftOp :: (MonadTrans f, Monad a, Monad b, HProfunctor p, HBifunctor p) => p a b -> p (f a) (f b)
liftOp = hmap lift

-- Now we can take the `write` and `tell` of an arbitrary monad, and promote them to implementations of `write` and `tell` for an arbitrary
-- transformation of that monad. Moreover, the promotion process is fully generalized, and no longer cares about the shape of the operation
-- (provided you have witnessed `HProfunctor` and `HBifunctor`).

-- To convince you that the single definition above works for all six combinations of `write`, `tell` with the transformers `ExceptT`, `ReaderT`, `StateT`

writeExcept :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Write w m n -> Write w (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n)
writeExcept = liftOp

tellExcept :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Tell w m n -> Tell w (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n)
tellExcept = liftOp

writeReader :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Write w m n -> Write w (ReaderT r m) (ReaderT r n)
writeReader = liftOp

tellReader :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Tell w m n -> Tell w (ReaderT r m) (ReaderT r n)
tellReader = liftOp

writeState :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Write w m n -> Write w (StateT s m) (StateT s n)
writeState = liftOp

tellState :: (Monad m, Monad n) => Tell w m n -> Tell w (StateT s m) (StateT s n)
tellState = liftOp

-- Where there are profunctors, there are optics. The eagle-eyed reader might notice that the previous definitions are actually examples of profunctor optics:

-- type HOptic p s t a b = p a b -> p s t
-- type HReview  s t a b = forall p. (HProfunctor p, HBifunctor p) => p a b -> p s t

-- liftOp :: (MonadTrans f, Monad a, Monad b) => HReview (f a) (f b) a b

-- Profunctor optics will keep cropping up in the ensuing discussion. In some cases we might explicitly write `P a b -> P s t` instead of using the type
-- synonym `HOptic`, so keep an eye out.

-- So far so good. The ease with which we dealt with the covariant operations leads one to wonder what the point of the weird `n` `m` parameter split
-- is in the first place. Surely we can dispense with the "phantom" profunctor in favor of a simple covariant functor?

-- Unfortunately, unlike `write` and `tell`, some operations are in the habit of eating up a term in an effectful context in addition to producing one.
-- These operations not phantom in their negative type parameter, and so we cannot witness an HBifunctor for them.

-- Thus we must give up our habit of shouting `liftOp` at various monad transformers, and come up with new tools to deal with `listen` and `pass`.

-- Let's first state what our goal is:

ourGoal :: (Functor m, Functor n) => HOptic (Listen w) (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n) m n

-- Without referring to any abstractions for the moment, let's just try implementing the concrete combination where
-- we promote the `listen` operation for the `ExceptT` transformer.

ourGoal (Listen l) = Listen $ ExceptT . fmap (\(w, fa) -> fmap (w,) fa) . l . runExceptT

-- So far so good. Now if we forget about `listen` specifically, we can try and imagine what we need from a `listen`-like
-- operation in order to be able to promote it over `ExceptT`.

-- To start with, we'll need at least an HProfunctor, so that we can unwrap and rewrap `ExceptT` at the edges, as seen in the concrete implementation above.

-- Since we can only map an `HProfunctor` using natural transformations, we need to unpack `ExceptT e m a` into something of the form `??? a`. `ExceptT e m a`
-- unpacks into `m (Either e a)`. In order to unify it with `??? a`, we can use the `Compose` newtype to get `Compose m (Either e) a`.

abstractlyPromoteOverExceptT :: (Functor m, Functor n, HProfunctor p) => HOptic p (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n) m n
abstractlyPromoteOverExceptT =
  hdimap (Compose . runExceptT) (ExceptT . getCompose) . undefined

-- The type of the missing piece is now:

-- ??? :: HOptic p (m :.: Either e) (n :.: Either e) m n

-- (where `f :.: g` is `Compose f g`)

-- If you're familiar with the `Strong` typeclass from regular profunctor optics, you might see the parallel with:

-- first' :: Strong p => Optic p (m, x) (n, x) m n

-- The operation we want is essentially like `first`, but with type variables of kind `* -> *` instead of kind `*`, and functor
-- composition taking the place of tupling.

-- We will call the requisite subclass of `HProfunctor` "HLeftComposing":

-- class HProfunctor p => HLeftComposing p
--   where
--   type Inside p = (* -> *) -> Constraint
--   type Inside p = Functor
--
--   houtside :: (Functor m, Functor n, Inside p x) => HOptic p (m :.: x) (n :.: x) m n

-- Having postulated the missing piece using an additional constraint, we can complete the puzzle:

abstractlyPromoteOverExceptT' :: (Functor m, Functor n, Inside p (Either e), HLeftComposing p) => HOptic p (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n) m n
abstractlyPromoteOverExceptT' =
  hdimap (Compose . runExceptT) (ExceptT . getCompose) . houtside

-- As we would expect, the relevant bits from the `listen`-specific implementation factor out into an instance of this class:

lstrength :: Functor f => (a, f b) -> f (a, b)
lstrength (a, fb) = fmap (a,) fb

instance HLeftComposing (Listen w)
  where
  houtside (Listen l) = Listen $ Compose . fmap lstrength . l . getCompose

-- Unlike tupling, functor composition is not symmetric. While there is an isomorphism `(a , b) â‰… (b , a)`, there is no analogous
-- isomorphism in general between `a :.: b` and `b :.: a`. So while `first'` and `second'` are equivalent minimal definitions in a
-- single `Strong` class, when it comes to functor composition we will need a separate class for the reverse notion of focusing on
-- a functor on the "inside" of a functor composition.

-- Enter `HRightComposing` and its operation `hinside`:

-- class HProfunctor p => HRightComposing p
--   where
--   type Outside p = (* -> *) -> Constraint
--   type Outside p = Functor
--
--   hinside :: (Functor m, Functor n, Outside p x) => HOptic p (x :.: m) (x :.: n) m n

-- And the `listen` operation has an instance for this as well:

instance HRightComposing (Listen w)
  where
  hinside (Listen l) = Listen $ Compose . fmap l . getCompose

-- The `pass` operation likewise has instances for these two classes:

instance HLeftComposing (Pass w)
  where
  type Inside (Pass w) = Traversable
  houtside (Pass f) = Pass $ Compose . f . fmap sequenceA . getCompose

instance HRightComposing (Pass w)
  where
  hinside (Pass p') = Pass $ Compose . fmap p' . getCompose

-- We've now decoupled the set of instances from the set of operations. The broad idea is this: for each monad transformer, we need to implement an
-- optic that focuses on its inner monad. The optic should be abstract, and should refer to `HProfunctor` and any necessary subclasses instead of
-- any specific `MonadXYZ` operations.

-- For clarity, we will ignore the scattered bits and pieces we've already defined in the preceding discussion, and implement each transformer's optic
-- from whole cloth below. In what follows `_1'` and `_2'` are respectively aliases for `houtside` and `hinside`, just quantified for more convenient
-- type application:

focusExceptT :: forall e m n p.
  ( Functor m
  , Functor n
  , Inside p (Either e)
  , HLeftComposing p
  ) =>
  HOptic p (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n) m n
focusExceptT = hcoerce . _1' @(Either e)

focusReaderT :: forall r m n p.
  ( Functor m
  , Functor n
  , Outside p ((->) r)
  , HRightComposing p
  ) =>
  HOptic p (ReaderT r m) (ReaderT r n) m n
focusReaderT = hcoerce . _2' @((->) r)

focusStateT :: forall s m n p.
  ( Functor m
  , Parametric m
  , Functor n
  , Parametric n
  , Outside p ((->) s)
  , Inside p (Flip (,) s)
  , HLeftComposing p
  , HRightComposing p
  ) =>
  HOptic p (StateT s m) (StateT s n) m n
focusStateT = hcoerce . _2' @((->) s) . _1' @(Flip (,) s)

-- For the operations themselves, we just need to witness instances of `HProfunctor` and any instantiable subclasses. Given a monad transformer whose optic demands
-- constraints satisfied by an operation, we can specialize the optic to the operation. The result is a function that takes an instance of the operation for the
-- inner monad, and produces an instance of the operation for the transformed monad.

-- Since we've already witnessed the requisite instances for `listen`, and `pass`, here (selected at random), are some illustrative specializations of the monad
-- transformer optics

listenStateT ::
  ( Functor m
  , Parametric m
  , Functor n
  , Parametric n
  ) =>
  Listen w m n -> Listen w (StateT s m) (StateT s n)
listenStateT = focusStateT

passReaderT :: (Functor m, Functor n) => Listen w m n -> Listen w (ReaderT w m) (ReaderT w n)
passReaderT = focusReaderT

listenExceptT :: (Functor m, Functor n) => Listen w m n -> Listen w (ExceptT w m) (ExceptT w n)
listenExceptT = focusExceptT

-- Finally, given a way to promote each operation, we obtain a way to promote a complete set of operations. I.e. we have:

mapMonadWriter :: HOptic (Write w) s t a b -> HOptic (Tell w) s t a b -> HOptic (Listen w) s t a b -> HOptic (Pass w) s t a b -> HOptic (MonadWriter w) s t a b
mapMonadWriter w t l p (MonadWriter wv tv lv pv) = MonadWriter (w wv) (t tv) (l lv) (p pv)

-- Thus the overall formula for writing the "lifting" instances we are familiar with in MTL is:

-- MonadWriter w m => MonadWriter w (ExceptT e m)
mwriterExceptT :: Monad m => MonadWriter w m m -> MonadWriter w (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e m)
mwriterExceptT = mapMonadWriter liftOp liftOp focusExceptT focusExceptT

-- MonadWriter w m => MonadWriter w (ReaderT r m)
mwriterReaderT :: Monad m => MonadWriter w m m -> MonadWriter w (ReaderT r m) (ReaderT r m)
mwriterReaderT = mapMonadWriter liftOp liftOp focusReaderT focusReaderT

-- MonadWriter w m => MonadWriter w (StateT s m)
mwriterStateT :: (Parametric m, Monad m) => MonadWriter w m m -> MonadWriter w (StateT s m) (StateT s m)
mwriterStateT = mapMonadWriter liftOp liftOp focusStateT focusStateT

-- Additionally, when some new `MonadXYZ` class comes along with its own set of operations, e.g:

newtype Ask r m n = Ask { getAsk :: n r }

instance HProfunctor (Ask r)
  where
  hdimap _ g (Ask v) = Ask $ g v

instance HBifunctor (Ask r)
  where
  hbimap _ g (Ask v) = Ask $ g v

newtype Local r m n = Local { getLocal :: forall x. (r -> r) -> m x -> n x }

instance HRightComposing (Local r)
  where

newtype Read' r m n = Read { getRead :: forall a. (r -> a) -> n a }

instance HProfunctor (Read' r)
  where
  hdimap _ g (Read r) = Read $ g . r

instance HBifunctor (Read' r)
  where
  hbimap _ g (Read r) = Read $ g . r

data MonadReader r m n
  = MonadReader

  }

mapMonadReader :: HOptic (Ask r) s t a b -> HOptic (Local r) s t a b -> HOptic (Read' r) s t a b -> HOptic (MonadReader r) s t a b
mapMonadReader a l r (MonadReader av lv rv) = MonadReader (a av) (l lv) (r rv)

-- We are well prepared to give "lifting" instances for our existing transformers:

mreaderExceptT :: (Monad m, Monad n) => MonadReader r m n -> MonadReader r (ExceptT e m) (ExceptT e n)

mreaderStateT :: (Monad m, Parametric m, Monad n, Parametric n) => MonadReader r m n -> MonadReader r (StateT s m) (StateT s n)
